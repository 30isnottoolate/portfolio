        description: <>This is a "What You See Is What You Get" text editor made in ReactJS with TypeScript. Also known as a "Rich Text" editor.

        description: <>The idea has come from the Stage Teleprompter project, but this one has less features. It is the first app I've made with React hooks and TypeScript. It has a simple, easy-to-use UI. <br/>A formula was developed for the ideal text sliding speed after a lot of experiments.</>,
