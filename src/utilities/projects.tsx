        description: <>This is a "What You See Is What You Get" text editor made in ReactJS with TypeScript. Also known as a "Rich Text" editor. Although this project does not adhere to the principles of ReactJS (because it contains direct DOM manipulation) it still was a challenging experiment.</>,
